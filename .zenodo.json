  "description": "This repository contains the open-source reproducibility package for the NPSTAR (Nonpoint Source Transport and Reduction) model. The package includes demonstration code, example datasets, and documentation for running a simplified total nitrogen (TN) simulation in small agricultural catchments. It supports full reproducibility and transparency following AGU and Water Resources Research open science requirements.",
