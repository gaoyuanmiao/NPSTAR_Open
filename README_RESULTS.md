# Results Directory

This folder contains example output files generated by the NPSTAR demo simulation.

## Files included
- **demo_TN_outlet.csv** — Modeled total nitrogen (TN) load at the outlet (in kg)
- **demo_TN_matrix.csv** — 2D spatial distribution of TN fluxes (synthetic demo data)

## Notes
- These files are **generated automatically** when running:
  ```bash
  python code/demo_run_npstar.py
  ```
- They are **synthetic** outputs included for demonstration of model reproducibility only.
- Full-resolution and long-term simulation results used in the paper are available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.
