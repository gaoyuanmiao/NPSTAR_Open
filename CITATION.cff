abstract 
  This repository provides the reproducibility package for the NPSTAR (Nonpoint Source Transport and Reduction)
  model. It contains open-source Python code, example datasets, and documentation to reproduce total nitrogen (TN)
  simulations for small agricultural catchments. The NPSTAR framework integrates distributed hydrological modeling
  with biogeochemical and management modules to quantify and mitigate nonpoint source pollution at high spatial
  resolution.
